                            <p>The Australian sharemarket has plunged at the start of trade in a reversal of fortune after euphoria yesterday greeted the first US Federal Reserve rate hikes in nearly a decade.A surging US dollar whacked commodity markets, which filtered through to local resources stocks on the local market this morning.At the 10.15am (AEDT) official market open, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 67.1 points, or 1.32 per cent, at 5034, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 62.6 points, or 1.22 per cent, to 5088.The local market was buffeted following international developments, as the fallout from the Fed’s first interest rate hike in a decade spreads through global markets.Wall Street stocks were down almost 1 per cent overnight, dragged down by energy stocks, a day after rallying on the Fed decision.“The global macro dynamics from the beginning of a Fed rate hiking cycle are slowly playing out across the world,” IG strategist Angus Nicholson said.“In the direct wake of the decision we have seen some dramatic moves in central bank policy with Taiwan cutting its benchmark interest rate, Hong Kong and Mexico both hiking rates, and Argentina removing currency controls and devaluing the peso by 30 per cent,” Mr Nicholson said.CMC Market chief analyst Ric Spooner said US markets poured cold water on yesterday’s rapturous response to the Fed rate hike.“This will see volatility continue into the year end. After gaining 4 per cent over two days, the ASX 200 index is vulnerable to some profit taking and a soft end to a volatile week,” Mr Spooner said.“However, a weaker Australian dollar overnight will help soften the blow for Australian markets.”The Australian dollar slid to a one-month low on the strong US currency, dropping below the US71c handle for the first time since November 18.’The stronger US dollar also hammered commodity prices, which put local resources stocks into a spin at the start of trade on the local exchange.Gold slumped 2.5 per cent $US1,049.60 an ounce. US Nymex crude skidded 1.6 per cent to $US35, while global benchmark Brent crude slipped 0.8 per cent to $US37.Zinc prices have sunk to their lowest in nearly six and a half years and other industrial metals also fell. However, iron ore managed to eke out a slight increase.BHP slid 2.88 per cent to $16.53 while Rio Tinto slid 2.65 per cent to $42.21.Gold miner St Barbara plunged 9.23 per cent to $1.18 while Newcrest slumped 2.88 per cent to $12.47.Energy stocks were sold off, with Woodside falling 1.01 per cent $36.55 while Santos slipped 0.57 per cent to $3.46.The banks were heavily sold off, with Westpac down $31.61 and NAB plunging 2.21 per cent to $28.30.CBA dropped 1.26 per cent to $79.67 while ANZ tanked 1.57 per cent to $26.13.ASXTelstra dropped 0.64 per cent to $5.405 while Qantas retreated 0.77 per cent to $3.87.In Australia, the market on Thursday closed higher with investors buoyed by the Fed’s vote of confidence in the world’s biggest economy.ANZ gained 0.39 per cent to $25.78 while CBA was up 0.76 per cent to $78.03.NAB jumped 0.82 per cent to $28.17 while Westpac moved forward 0.78 per cent to $30.90.Resources faced heavy selling in early trade.Rio Tinto moved down 1.97 per cent to $41.35 while BHP Billiton tanked 1.93 per cent to $16.28.Woodside Petroleum retreated 1.17 per cent to $26.10 while MMA Offshore fell 2.22 per cent to 22c.Supermarket stocks were up with the consumer discretionary sector buzzing. ANZ-Roy Morgan’s latest consumer confidence survey showed a slight weekly decline, but consumers are much more confident during this lead up to Christmas than last year.Woolworths was up 0.64 per cent to $22.735 while Wesfarmers gained 0.46 per cent to $37.40.Elsewhere, Qantas rallied 2.38 per cent to $3.87 after it said it was on track for a record-high interim profit. Telstra edged 0.87 per cent higher to $5.215 </p>
                            <p>ASX</p>
                            <p>Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 briefly turns positive after a 1.5% intraday fall.</p>
                            <p>The recovery has been led by the major banks, particularly CBA.</p>
                            <p>Despite the broadly unchanged “dotplot” of the Fed, which caused the US dollar strength and “risk-off” moves overnight, investors seem keen to park their cash in the market before Christmas, particularly given the extreme selloff of late.</p>
                            <p>Expect the index to test the downtrend line and 100-day moving average near 5200 while it remains above today’s low at 5026.6.</p>
                            <p>Index last down 0.1% at 5097.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The local market has bounced back from a 1.4 per cent fall at the open, with Telstra, CSL and the major banks leading the rebound.</p>
                            <p>At 11:40am AEDT the S&P/ASX 200 was 0.6 per cent weaker for the day at 5073.2 points.</p>
                            <p>Rio Tinto fell 3.1 per cent and BHP Billiton is down 2.5 per cent despite a rise in the iron ore price overnight.</p>
                            <p>Telstra and CSL gained 0.3 per cent and the big four banks were mixed, with CBA and Wespac only slightly weaker while NAB and ANZ lose over 1 per cent.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Ord Minnett initiated Blackmores research coverage today with a Buy rating and $230 price target, 17% above the current level around $205.9 a share – a new record for the stock.</p>
                            <p>Are they too late the party? It may seem so, given that the vitamin maker is up 481% this year – the best performer in the S&P/ASX 200.</p>
                            <p>But the key is that Blackmores’ normalized earnings per share is expected to surge almost five-fold in the next three years.</p>
                            <p>That will see its PE ratio drop from a pricey 74.1 times in FY15 to a cheap 15.4 times in FY18.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>A2 Milk jumped 35% to $1.40 a share after boosting its earnings guidance to a range of $33 million to $37 million, as much as 68% above prior guidance of $22 million.</p>
                            <p>A2 Milk last up 24% at $2.89.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>listed Brisbane-based Corporate Travel Management is expected to unveil a further expansion later Friday, shelling out $40 million to acquire another business.</p>
                            <p>The move marks further consolidation of the travel industry and comes on the heels of Flight Centre this week buying the Boston based Student Universe for A$38 million in a bid to expand further into the youth travel business.</p>
                            <p>The Australian understands details could be announced at midday.</p>
                            <p>CTM controls about 11 per cent of Australia’s corporate travel sector.</p>
